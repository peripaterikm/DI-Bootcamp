suggestions for improvement:
- In `get_words_from_file`, consider adding error handling for other potential file exceptions beyond `FileNotFoundError`.  For instance, `PermissionError` could occur.
- The `get_random_sentence` function could be improved by checking if the `words` list is empty *before* attempting to select random words. This would prevent errors if the file is empty or contains only whitespace.
- Improve user experience in `main` by providing more guidance on the file location for the word list. The program could display a clearer message indicating where the user should save `words.txt` relative to the script's location.
- Add more comprehensive input validation in the `main` function.  For example, check if the user inputs a negative integer or any non-numeric string.
